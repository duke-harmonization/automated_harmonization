Automated harmonization for stroke risk prediction variables

Introduction: Early identification of stroke risk can profoundly influence an individual's chance of survival. While machine learning-based stroke risk prediction models have shown better results than their traditional counterparts, their reliability and generalizability require integrating diverse open data sources. Yet, variable discrepancies – where the same concept is described differently – pose challenges for data integration and harmonization, often requiring time-intensive manual harmonization. To address this, we developed an automated harmonization technique using state-of-the-art natural language models.

Methods: We utilized data from the Atherosclerosis  Risk in Communities (ARIC), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Framingham Offspring Study , and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohorts. Our approach involved training a two-layer fully connected neural network (FCN) to predict a harmonized ‘concept variable’ based on variable descriptions. These predictions employed embeddings from Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). Further refining was achieved through paired sentence classification tasks to determine if variable description pairs shared identical concepts. We experimented with both separate cohort training as well as combined cohort training to evaluate context dependency.    We used cosine similarity between the embeddings of the pre-trained BioBERT encoder, without refinement, as a prediction score for our baseline method.
